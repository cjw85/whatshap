    Main method for the threading stage of the polyploid phasing algorithm. Takes the following input:

    readset -- The fragment matrix to phase
    clustering -- A list of clusters. Each cluster is a list of read ids, indicating which reads it contains. Every read can
                  only be present in one cluster.
    ploidy -- Number of haplotypes to phase
    block_cut_sensitivity -- Policy how conversative the block cuts have to be done. 0 is one phasing block no matter what, 5
                             is very short blocks

    For every variant, the threading algorithm finds a tuple of clusters through which the haplotypes can be threaded with
    minimal cost. Costs arise when the positional coverage of a cluster does not match the number of haplotypes threaded through it
    or when haplotypes switch the cluster on two consecutive positions.
